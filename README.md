# DressingFramework - DK
A framework that assembles DressingTools and allows the creation of modular plugins for avatars.

## API Stability

:warning: Very unstable. Currently, it is only intended to use internally by my own tools. Use at your own risk. :warning:

## Features

- Automatic non-destructive build while uploading avatars or entering play mode
- Sequencing passes executions by specifying before/after constraints and categorizing into different stages
- Animation scanning and path remapping are supported
- Non-VRChat workflows supported
- Acts as an avatar and build abstraction layer on top of other non-destructive frameworks

## Removed/not available currently

- Standardized logging and reporting system
- Platform-independent avatar dynamics scanning
- Reading values from DynamicBones and VRCPhysBone without them installed (WIP)
